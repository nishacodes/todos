# Blackjack!

## Objective
# Practice contional logic including nested conditionals. 
# Use methods to keep our code DRY.

## Instructions
# We are going to build a command line blackjack game.  
# A player gets dealt two cards which have values between 1-11.  
# After they get dealt two cards you should show them the total 
# score of their cards and ask them if they want to hit or stay. 
# A player is allowed to "hit" up to two times.  After each hit you 
# should ask if they want to hit or stay and display the total value of their cards. 
# If they don't want to hit, and they are not at 21 they lose.  
# Your program should tell them they lose and exit.

## Note:  To take input from the person "playing" the game your program 
# will have to use the Ruby method "gets".

## Challenge
# After successfully completing the previous game (there should be a 
# commit with a working version of this game), alter the game so that a
# player can "hit" as many times as they want.
